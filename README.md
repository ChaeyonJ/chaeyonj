# Hi there!
### I’m currently a senior attending Washington and Lee University. I’m currently an Accounting and Finance Major and a Data Science in Business Analytics Minor. I’m looking to work in a career in finance.  I am interested in a career in the finance industry because I enjoy learning about different companies and how decisions made by large firms can influence the economy. Through my experiences as a Girls Who Invest Scholar and an analyst at W&L's investment society, I have gained a stronger interest and a more diverse skillset that drives my interest in financeAfter graduation, I plan on working as an analyst at Wells Fargo.
